At the time I was still learning how to program I came across an amazing YouTube channel called
[The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain), that featured a crazy but awesome teacher that
with an interesting approach to teaching. His videos are mostly of him building projects using a JavaScript
library called [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) which is a JavaScript variant of [Processing](https://processing.org/).

This library is mostly used for _creative_ programming that allows you to build graphics through code.
It's fairly simple to use and actually kinda fun.

I've used it to make little _doodles_ to train my programming skills. I even used it for a college project for an
art class when the COVID pandemic first hit.

Here's a list of the _doodles_ I've built:

## Tortuga Artificial

This _doodle_ was my final project for a particular course that I had to take in college. It treated the subject
of how art and science are actually closely related to each other than people may think. The course was pretty
interesting, but I took it at the beginning of the year 2020, and we all know what happened then.

At my campus, there's a small lake that has some turtles. My initial idea project was to build a small 3D printed
turtle, attach some wheels, a motor and a camera to record the turtle's POV. This _artificial_ turtle would then
be inserted in the habitat of the other _real_ turtles and record their interactions. The goal was to record
the behavior of natural living beings when exposed to artificial organisms that mimic them.

The pandemic then hit, and we all had to study remotely through Zoom, and my idea was no longer possible. I had to
settle for a more simplified version, which meant simulating it through a small _game_.

## Game of Life

Ever heard of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)? Yeah, it's that but
built with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/).

## Etch-a-Sketch

A classic toy from when I was a kid. Incidentally, I never owned one myself, but I always wanted to have one.

## Snake

This was the very first _doodle_ I made. Beware, it has bugs üêõ.
