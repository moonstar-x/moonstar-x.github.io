StarPep Web is a non-redundant database of over 45000 antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) recompiled and normalized
from various sources. The idea is to have a central place for researchers to find information regarding
antimicrobial peptides.

This project is still under development. This article will remain empty until the project is finally
released to the public.
