I always thought that creating a little project for yourself in order to learn a new technology is a great
way to get good with it. As a means to learn Svelte, I decided to go and build myself a little dashboard kind of app
where I could access all my [self-hosted services](../server-setup-guide) from the same place.

It was a fairly good project. It worked well, except for the applications that didn't support being framed. Although for
this very reason, I decided to deprecate it.
