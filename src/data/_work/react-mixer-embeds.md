Back in 2020, my buddies and I were building a small website for ourselves as a sort of gaming community.
We were a bit into streaming video games, even if that failed miserably since we averaged 0 viewers per stream.
Particularly, we were still checking out the platforms available, and I had found out about
[Mixer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixer_(service)). It seemed like an interesting platform, even before
one of the biggest Twitch streamers at the time had signed a contract with them which supposedly would've 
brought a lot of new customers to the platform. Needless to say, they _killed off_ the platform. They were
bought by Meta and are now [Facebook Gaming](https://facebook.com/gaming).

However, before that happened I had a plan to learn how to build component libraries for React and that's
when the idea hit. I wanted to embed Mixer streams into our gaming website, and what better way to do it
through my own embed library? So I decided to build it.

Sadly though, a few months later, the service was sunset forever, and I was left with my very first
deprecated project.

RIP Mixer. üïäÔ∏è
