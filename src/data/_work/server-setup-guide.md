Since 2014, one of my hobbies has been self-hosting. I had an old HP laptop that I used as a Plex server to watch
my TV Shows back then.

Since 2016, I built a desktop computer than I use to this day for self-hosting lots of different services.

This has been an amazing project, everything I know about Linux, Docker, networking, I owe it to hosting my own services
on my own hardware. Even to this day, I still self-host many of the services I use to this day in this desktop computer
along with 2 other VPSs.

To document everything I have, and how it's configured, I decided to make a simple site with all this information,
publicly accessible as well to not only work for my own reference but others' as well.
