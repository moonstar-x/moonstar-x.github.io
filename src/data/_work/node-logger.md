This is one of the first libraries I had ever made to be published on NPM. A fairly simple one as well,
some logging utilities that use Chalk to get some colorful console messages depending on the log level.

Initially published as [@greencoast/logger](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@greencoast/logger), I decided to migrate this
to my own account for easier maintainability.
