After completing the [Continuum](../continuum) project, I worked with [Andrés Marcial](https://marcialcoba.carbonmade.com)
to release a new project with the similar concept, a new one called Tricentenario which featured the same BLE beacon based
localization method to display different videos depending on the user's position in the museum.

For more information, please visit [Andrés' publication](https://marcialcoba.carbonmade.com/projects/7274171) in his portfolio
