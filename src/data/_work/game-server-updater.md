Additional to [self-hosting services](../server-setup-guide) I also enjoyed self-hosting game servers. SteamCMD has always
been the way to go for me to acquire the server binaries and get to hosting my own game servers for me and my friends.

Only recently however I got the idea of creating a little tool to help me host my own game servers. More specifically,
for Arma 3, which is an amazing game but relatively complicated to set up, even more so if the server has mods in it.
Downloading and updating the mods for this game server can sometimes be a pain because of all the steps to follow.

Luckily, most of these steps are actually very consistent and can be easily automated, which is what I wanted for this
little tool.

Now, it's got some scripts to download and update game servers for different types of games from SteamCMD.
